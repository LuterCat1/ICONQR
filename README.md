# QR Code Generator with Icon

This project is a web-based QR code generator that allows users to input a URL and embed a custom icon in the center of the QR code. The interface is styled with CSS, and the QR code is generated and customized using the qr-code-styling library in JavaScript. Users can generate the QR code by entering a URL, uploading an icon, and then download the resulting QR code as a PNG file. To use, simply open index.html in a browser, input your data, and follow the on-screen instructions.

``` git clone github.com/LuterCat1/ICONQR.git ```
